# 👋 About Me

- 🧠 I'm currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in Cybersecurity**, exploring the darker (but legal!) corners of tech.
- 🎨 A naturally curious and creative developer — I love building things from scratch and turning ideas into real solutions.
- 💻 I enjoy working across the stack and tackling challenges that make me think twice (or five times).
- 🌱 Always learning — whether it’s a new technology, tool or just how to properly explain recursion.
- ⚡ When I truly enjoy something, I give it my all — constantly looking for ways to improve and automate it wherever possible.
- 📚 I may make mistakes, but I always learn from the falls — after all, it’s the setbacks that help us grow.
- 🧰 I believe in writing clean code, continuous improvement, and the occasional well-placed comment with dry humour.
